# CTF Courses

This collection of courses is meant to help ENSIAS students in the INSEC club learn the basics of how CTF competitions work and the various challenge types that they will encounter. These topics include: linux, scripting, OSINT, reverse engineering, forensics, cryptography, binary exploitation, web app exploitation, and steganography.

CTFs are "Capture-The-Flag" cyber competitions. These are generally layed out like Jeopardy, with various topics containing challenges/questions ranging in difficulty that are assigned a certain point value. The team that gets the most points wins. There are a lot of resources online, and thus it can be overwhelming when trying to figure out what you even need to learn or where to start. These courses are meant to help solve this issue by compiling relevant resources in one place and providing our own material for each topic based on what we think is important to know for getting started with CTFs.
